This code uses Tailwind's gradient utility classes. However, if you encounter issues, like the gradient not appearing or rendering incorrectly, double-check the following:

1. **Correct CSS Order:** Ensure your Tailwind directives (e.g., `@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;`) are correctly placed in your CSS file.
2. **Plugin Installation:** If you're using a plugin that extends Tailwind's functionality (e.g., gradient plugins), make sure it's correctly installed and configured.
3. **Browser Compatibility:** Gradient support can vary across browsers.  Test in various browsers to see if the issue is browser-specific. 
4. **Conflicting Styles:** Conflicting styles can interfere with Tailwind's styling. Use your browser's developer tools to check for any CSS rules that might be overriding the gradient styles. 5. **Typographical Errors:** Verify that class names are spelled correctly without any typos. A small error can cause the styles to not apply.
6. **Purge Configuration:** If you're using PurgeCSS or a similar tool, ensure that your gradient classes are not being purged from the final CSS output.
7. **Tailwind Version:** Check for compatibility issues between your Tailwind version and other dependencies.  Older versions might lack full gradient support. 
8. **CSS Preprocessors:** If you're using a CSS preprocessor (like Sass or Less), ensure that the Tailwind directives and your custom CSS are correctly processed and compiled.
